Merging the projects:
we have decided after discussion to use kfir’s projects with a little changes in implementation from avihay’s project.
The reason was that kfir’s project was more OOP style with more using in enum and typdef.
The implementation from avihay’s project was to use less in pointers and more references with the minimum using of ‘new’.
